TM::IP::Document
================

This is a Catalyst controller which offers RESTful methods to manage
documents inside a Topic Maps based document repository. With that
protocol you can currently PUT documents into the store, GET them back
and maybe delete them. There is also a way to retrieve the index.


See TM::IP::Documents::Controller::Root.

Run script/tm_ip_documents_server.pl to test the application.
